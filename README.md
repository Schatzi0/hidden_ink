# HiddenInk
HiddenInk is a demonstrative tool of how image steganography can be used to encode characters into an image by manipulating its pixels and thus transmit the classified information via retrieval of that image.

# Working
There is alteration and manipulation in the RGB channels of the pixels such that we encode characters as information hidden in the channels.

# Encoding Capacity
The capacity depends on how large the size of the image is, if it's 100x100 pixels, then the capacity would be 10000 characters.
